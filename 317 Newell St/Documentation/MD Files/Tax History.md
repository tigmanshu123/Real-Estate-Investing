## Overview of Tax History

Analyzing the tax history data reveals both increases and decreases in property tax and assessed value over time.

1. **Recent Trends (approximately 2023)**:
   - The most recent year shows a tax increase rate of **12.10%** with taxes paid amounting to **$1286** and a property value of **$25,050**. The property value increased by **29.21%** compared to the previous year, indicating a notable uptick in assessed value.

2. **Stability Phase (approximately 2020 - 2022)**:
   - During this period, the property value remained constant at **$19,387** while the taxes hovered around the **$1,145 - $1,147** mark with marginal tax increase rates, suggesting a phase of stability with negligible property value appreciation.

3. **Tax Fluctuations in Earlier Years (approximately 2018 - 2019)**:
   - A substantial **25.17%** increase in property value occurred around 2020, though specific tax paid details are missing for this year.
   - Prior to 2020, the tax paid decreased by approximately **10.89%** around 2019 with taxes at **$990.04** and a slight decrease in value to **$15,488** suggesting a possibly favorable adjustment for the owner at the time.

4. **Consistent Increases and Decreases Early in the Decade (approximately 2010 - 2017)**:
   - The property experienced slight decreases and increases in value and tax over the years, with notable value depreciation of approximately **17.24%** around 2014, aligning with a decrease in taxes **-14.19%** to **$1,075.18**.

5. **Long-term Historical Data (2000 and earlier)**:
   - The data from the early 2000s showed steadier growth trends with a significant **52.33%** value increase hitting **$21,102** around 2002 and a tax paid spike at **$720.28**. Prior decades reflected modest tax increases aligning with economic growth patterns.

## Potential Risks

1. **Recent Value Spikes**:
   - The **29.21%** increase in assessed value in approximately 2023 signals rapid property appreciation which might suggest potential over-assessment risks if such trends do not align with broader market conditions.

2. **Tax Volatility**:
   - The fluctuation in taxes paid, particularly the significant **12.10%** increase in the most recent data year, could indicate vulnerability to policy changes or inconsistent assessment approaches.

3. **Inconsistent Evaluation Intervals**:
   - Missing data points for certain years like 2020, and the sporadic reporting (e.g., complete absence of tax data during the economic downturn phases), might pose challenges in accurately forecasting future tax expectations.

## Summary

Overall, the tax history reflects both stability and volatility across different periods, with recent years showing significant property value and tax increase. The risks are mainly associated with these recent sharp increases and underlying market dynamics, which might indicate either a boom in property demand or potential over-valuation concerns. Monitoring broader economic and regional real estate trends will be crucial to anticipate future tax liabilities effectively.
