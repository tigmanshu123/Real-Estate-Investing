## Assessment Summary

Upon examining the property characteristics, the single-family home built in 1908 offers a generous living space of 1,384 square feet with 3 bedrooms and 1 bathroom, making it suitable for a small family. The property provides essential features such as a two-car garage and a fenced backyard, enhancing its utility and privacy. Notably, the HVAC system is serviced by forced air and gas, complemented by central air cooling, ensuring comfort in varying climates. 

However, potential risks are observable; for instance, there are several missing data points including appliances, HOA fees, utilities, and property condition. These omissions, like the unspecified state of the utilities and property condition, may indicate additional cost burdens or structural issues, especially since the description mentions the property "needs TLC" and is "subject to short sale approval." These aspects coupled with the property's age suggest an assessment of any ongoing maintenance or restoration costs. This, alongside a short sale process, could extend the transaction timeline and introduce additional complexities.
