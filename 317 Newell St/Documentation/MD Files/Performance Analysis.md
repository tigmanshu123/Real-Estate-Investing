## Assessment of Potential Investment Property

**Overall CAGR and Return:**

Analyzing the data, the investment property shows an improvement in its Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) over time. Initially, the CAGR is quite poor, starting at -100% in Year 0. This negative growth can be attributed to the significant upfront costs and initial negative cash flows, such as the "Annual Cash Flow" of -3427.63 in Year 0 and -1031.45 in Year 1, combined with relatively modest increases in "Home Equity". As the years progress, however, the CAGR gradually improves, reaching positive figures starting in Year 5 at 0.74%, and further increasing up to 6.02% by Year 29. 

The "Overall Return" trajectory also indicates growth. From a modest return of 22,300.73 in Year 0, it steadily rises to reach 239,267.69 by Year 29. This positive trend suggests a continually increasing net gain generated by the investment, heavily supported by the growth in "Home Equity" and gradually improving "Annual Cash Flow."

**Risks and Considerations:**

1. **Early-Stage Losses and Negative Cash Flow:** The persistent negative "Annual Cash Flow" in the initial years, particularly between Year 0 and Year 14, could pose cash flow challenges. This aspect demands attention to budgeting and financing plans, especially in the early years when the return is not yet positive.

2. **Sales Costs:** The impact of "Sales Cost" fluctuates alongside the increasing "Home Value". By Year 29, the "Sales Cost" reaches 20,599.80, indicating significant costs associated with selling the property. These costs must be carefully considered in the exit strategy to ensure they do not unexpectedly erode the perceived gains.

3. **Slow Return Stabilization:** The transition from a negative to a positive and stable "Overall CAGR" is relatively slow, with the CAGR stabilizing above 6% only after over 20 years. Investors should be prepared for a long-term hold to realize meaningful gains.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, this investment property exhibits potential for long-term gain, primarily driven by appreciating "Home Value" and increasing "Home Equity" over the years. However, the initial negative cash flows and sales costs must be carefully managed. Investors would benefit from a strong financial plan that supports cash flow needs until the property begins to generate net positive returns. Patience and a long-term investment horizon are crucial to unlocking this property's full potential.

## Assessment of CoCRoI

The **Cash on Cash Return on Investment (CoCRoI)** provides insights into the profitability of the investment property when compared to the cash invested, excluding the financing costs. The analysis of the provided data over a 30-year span showcases a gradual transition from negative CoCRoI values towards positive growth.

## Initial Years (Year 0-14)

- The investment begins with a **negative CoCRoI** of -7.91% in Year 0, which can be attributed to initial setup costs and a substantial negative annual cash flow of -$3,470.96.
- Throughout the first 14 years, the CoCRoI remains negative, mitigating very slowly but consistently, dropping to -0.09% in Year 14. This indicates prolonged initial financial strain where the property hasn't yielded net positive returns.
- The **Annual Cash Flow** reflects the burden, starting at -$3,470.96 in Year 0 and gradually increasing to -$40.01 by Year 14. Still, cumulative losses persist due to cash outflows surpassing inflows.

## Mid to Later Years (Year 15-29)

- Year 15 marks a turning point with a **positive CoCRoI** of 0.168%, and an Annual Cash Flow of $73.89. This indicates the property starting to generate positive cash flow compared to the initial investment.
- A promising upward trend is noted as the CoCRoI continues to improve, reaching 5.36% by Year 29, along with a robust Annual Cash Flow of $2,352.50. This reflects improving financial health and potential growth.
- The pace of CoCRoI increase suggests a long-term investment payoff as the cash inflow overtakes cash outflow significantly over the years.

## Year 30

- Year 30 observes an unexpected dip in CoCRoI to 0.44% with an Annual Cash Flow of $192.00. This sudden drop is atypical compared to the prior year-on-year increments and warrants a deeper investigation into the cause — be it increased operational costs, market fluctuations, or other exogenous factors.

## Risks and Considerations

1. **Prolonged Negative Cash Flow**: With 15 years of negative cash flows, investors may face liquidity challenges before reaping benefits in the latter years. Attention to capital reserves and patience will be critical during these periods.
   
2. **Initial Return Challenges**: The early years reflect high initial costs and low revenues, where the CoCRoI remains negative. Investors need to assess their risk tolerance to sustain through these durations without immediate return expectations.

3. **Unexplained Fluctuation Year 30**: The downturn in Year 30 calls for pinpointing underlying issues and ensuring it doesn't turn into a structural problem, affecting future profitability.

## Conclusion

The investment ultimately appears viable with long-term capital gains and strengthening CoCRoI post-Year 15. However, early negative returns pose a substantial risk, requiring investors to be financially equipped to support the property until it stabilizes and starts generating desirable returns. Initial periods of investment need strategic cash management, foresight, and possibly a structured plan to mitigate the risks associated with early operational years.

| Time Horizon | CAGR  |
|--------------|-------|
| 3-Year       | 24.79% |
| 5-Year       | 19.83% |
| 10-Year      | 11.75% |

## Summary Assessment

The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) data is critical for evaluating the investment's historical performance and projecting future growth. The 3-Year CAGR of **24.79%** suggests a strong recent upward trend, indicating high short-term gains. This could potentially be attributed to favorable market conditions, increased demand, or significant developments in the property or surrounding infrastructure. However, such substantial growth might not be sustainable long-term.

The 5-Year CAGR at **19.83%** reflects a commendable performance over a slightly longer period. This moderate decrease from the 3-year CAGR suggests either a normalization of growth after a more speculative peak or a potential plateau as market dynamics shift.

The 10-Year CAGR of **11.75%** indicates a more stabilized long-term growth, which is consistent with expected returns in real estate investment, where values typically exhibit gradual increase over extensive periods. This figure suggests the property has historically been a solid, but not extraordinarily performing, asset.

## Risks

- **Volatility**: The high 3-Year CAGR compared to the 10-Year CAGR signals potential volatility. Investors should be cautious about short-term fluctuations affecting their investment.
  
- **Sustainability**: With the significant growth observed in the recent past, there's a risk of regression towards the mean. The market may experience corrections that could affect future growth prospects, aligning more closely with historical long-term trends.

- **Market Conditions**: External factors such as economic shifts, policy changes, or unexpected events could significantly influence future property value trends. Buyers need to remain vigilant and consider macroeconomic indicators that might impact the real estate market.

These CAGRs depict a favorable historical performance; however, potential investors should carefully evaluate market contexts, potential shifts in demand, and ensure alignment with their long-term investment strategies.

## Historical Price Evolution Assessment

However, a downturn started swiftly after, with the property value declining to **$31,696** by August 2015 (`t=1438326000`) and reaching a low of **$25,474** by October 2015 (`t=1443596400`). The year closed with a recovery to **$27,838** (`t=1446274800`).

## Period of January 2016 to December 2016

Starting 2016 at **$29,074** in January (`t=1451548800`), the value increased moderately to **$30,464** by February 2016 (`t=1454227200`). It suffered a continual slide, reaching a low of **$24,206** by May 2016 (`t=1464678000`). A recovery throughout the latter half of the year saw values rebound, peaking at **$42,242** in November (`t=1477897200`), before closing the year just slightly lower at **$37,628** (`t=1480492800`).

## Recovery and Stability Period (2017-2019)

During this period, values exhibited relative stability and moderately positive growth. The value started 2017 at **$36,994** (`t=1483171200`) with a steady increase that saw it peak at **$68,891** in August 2019 (`t=1564556400`). Noteworthy is the zenith reached in July 2019 indicating strong market influence or substantial improvements driving prices.

## Stability and Volatility (2020-Present)

The property saw a stable yet slightly oscillating trend moving through 2020, with minor fluctuations around **$60,000**. Starting 2021, the property began at **$66,141** (`t=1612080000`), rising to an apex of **$77,187** in April 2021 (`t=1619766000`) before settling around **$76,100** by 2022 (`t=1640937600`). However, the most exciting movement is marked in July 2023 onwards, where values surged to **$148,300** in December 2024 (`t=1727679600`). 

## Risks and Considerations

1. **Market Volatility**: The sharp rise in property values from **July 2023** to **December 2024** merits caution. This rapid incline could reflect speculative market activity or transient factors rather than stable, intrinsic property value increases.

2. **Historical Fluctuations**: The property history reveals several downtrends (e.g., between **2015-2016**), suggesting market risks due to economic conditions that could reoccur.

3. **Potential Overvaluation**: The peak valuation at **$148,300** (forecast in December 2024, `t=1727679600`) may suggest an overestimated market if not supported by substantive property or infrastructure improvements.

4. **Economic Influence**: Broader economic shifts, policy changes, or regional developments could further impact property valuations, demanding keen attention.

In conclusion, while the recent sharp increase in value looks promising, investors should cautiously analyze driving factors and ensure sustained demand supports valuations to mitigate risks of value corrections.

## Table
| Metric                                   | Value |
|------------------------------------------|-------|
| Zestimate to Purchase price delta (percentage) | 2.00  |

## Assessment Summary
The data indicates that the Zestimate price is 2.00% higher than the purchase price. This is a positive sign, suggesting that the property is being acquired at a price below its estimated market value. Buying a property below the market value provides a potential for immediate equity gain, which is beneficial for future resale value or refinancing opportunities. 

However, a critical risk to consider here is the relatively modest difference of only 2.00%. While still positive, this small percentage suggests that the margin of safety is thin. If the market valuation around the area fluctuates or if there are inaccuracies in the Zestimate, the financial upside could be negligible or potentially negative. Hence, it would be prudent to conduct a thorough investigation into market trends and property-specific factors to ensure that the Zestimate is reliable and in alignment with other property valuations.
