## Table of Estimated Rents

| Type             | Estimated Rent |
|------------------|----------------|
| Median Rent      | 1283.33        |
| Average Rent     | 1279.00        |
| 25th Percentile  | 1171.00        |
| 75th Percentile  | 1282.50        |

## Assessment of Estimated Rents

Based on the data provided:

- **Median and Average Rent:** The median rent is $1283.33, while the average rent is $1279.00. The median being slightly higher than the average suggests a relatively symmetrical distribution of rents, but with a slight right skew where higher rent estimates have a minor pull.

- **25th and 75th Percentiles:** The 25th percentile is $1171.00 and the 75th percentile is $1282.50. This indicates that 50% of all estimated rents fall within this $111.50 range. The narrow range from the 25th to the 75th percentile implies low variability in the middle 50% of the rent estimates. 

## Summary and Risks

- **Trend Indications:** The relatively close proximity between the median and the 75th percentile ($1283.33 and $1282.50, respectively) implies that a significant portion of the market operates near the higher quartile range of rent prices. 

- **Risk Identification:** The average rent ($1279.00) being slightly less than the 75th percentile indicates potential outliers or a slight clustering just below the upper quartile, which may point to risk in situations where market shifts or additional data points push the balance further upwards or downwards. Should rents increase significantly, any shock could push more units into a higher pricing tier than presently cushioned by the data's quartile spread. 

This assessment suggests that the rent prices in the area are generally stable but businesses or investments relying on lower quintile estimations should be cautious of market trends that could compress these margins further into the profit-critical quartiles. It's crucial for stakeholders to remain vigilant and observe any emerging patterns or deviations that may affect future estimated rents.
