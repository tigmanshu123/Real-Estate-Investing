| 75th Percentile  | $1352.75       |

## Summary of Estimated Rent Analysis

Examining the data from the json reveals several key points about the estimated rents:

1. **Central Tendency Measures**: 
   - The **median rent** is $1384.00, and the **average rent** is slightly lower at $1378.00. This slight difference suggests that the rent distribution is relatively symmetrical with no significant outliers having a large impact, although it's slightly skewed left considering the median is higher than the average.

2. **Spread and Distribution**:
   - The **25th percentile** is $1260.75, while the **75th percentile** is $1352.75. This indicates that the middle 50% of rents fall within an approximate $92 range.
   - The narrow difference between the 25th and 75th percentile shows a relatively small spread in rental estimates, suggesting a concentrated rental price distribution around the central values.

3. **Potential Risks**:
   - The closeness of these data points, particularly the lesser variance between average and median rents, could indicate a lack of significant price differentiation in the rental market.
   - If the rents are tightly clustered with little variation, there may be limited scope for landlords in the area to adjust pricing competitively. This could pose a risk if broader market trends lead to price fluctuations that this narrowly distributed market cannot easily absorb.

Overall, the data suggests a homogeneous rental market with rents concentrated around the average and median values. This could mean stability in tenancy rates, however, it’s crucial to keep an eye on external economic trends or market shifts that might disrupt this relative steadiness.
