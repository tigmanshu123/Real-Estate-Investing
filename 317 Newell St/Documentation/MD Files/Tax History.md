## Assessment of Tax History

Upon analyzing the property's tax history from the provided dataset, certain patterns and trends emerge that can significantly inform any investment decisions.

## Evolution of Tax Payments

Tax payments have generally exhibited an upward trend over the years. It is important to note that:
- In **1999**, the tax paid was $495.20 on a property value of $13,853.
- By **2010**, the tax had significantly increased to approximately $1,084, despite the property value being close at $21,050.
- Recently, in **2023**, the tax paid was recorded at $1,286. This reflects a modest increase compared to the tax of $1,147.16 recorded in **2022**.

## Property Value and Tax Increase Correlation

The property's assessed value has shown fluctuations that directly correlate with tax changes:
- Notably, the property value rocketed by over 50% in **2002**, resulting in a consequent tax increase of approximately 34.5%.
- In more recent years, such as **2022 to 2023**, the property experienced a value increase rate of 29.2%, and the tax increase rate was 12.1%. This elucidates a strong connection between value increases and rising tax obligations.

## Observations on Property Value Fluctuations

There were some periods of property value reductions, which coincided with tax payments decreasing or remaining stable:
- In **2009**, a property value decrease of approximately 17.24% led to a notable reduction in taxes by around 14.19%.
- Another period of value decline occurred in **2018** where the property value reduced by 4.1%, but taxes slightly increased by about 2.6%, suggesting a delay in tax adjustments or additional influencing factors.

## Risks and Considerations

- The episodic nature of substantial increases in property value (e.g., over 52% in **2002**) raises potential risk concerns regarding unexpected spikes in tax liabilities.
- Periods where tax increases precede value increases, such as in **2015**, indicate potential local reassessments or policy changes, representing further risk for forecasting future tax liabilities.

The property's tax history not only serves as an essential indicator of financial obligations but also reflects on the region's real estate market dynamics, making it crucial for investors to consider these factors in their investment appraisal.
