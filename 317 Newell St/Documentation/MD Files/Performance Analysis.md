## Overall CAGR and Return Analysis

The investment property data presents an intriguing financial journey over 30 years. Looking through the provided dataset, which accounts for the `Overall CAGR` and `Overall Return`, we can create a narrative about the investment's performance and potential risks, as seen in each year.

Initially, the investment shows a negative `Overall CAGR` and `Overall Return`, with sharp losses in the first few years. During **Year 0**, the `Overall CAGR` stands at an alarming -100.0, while `Overall Return` is 21686.659135391703. By **Year 1**, the `Overall CAGR` shows improvement to -46.021939130679556 with an `Overall Return` of 23676.12694880568. This progression implies that although the investment remains at a loss, it's reducing as the years advance. 

Over time, from **Year 2** to **Year 9**, the `Overall CAGR` continues its upward trajectory from -23.258383376291025 to positive growth noted in **Year 9** at 0.6759520734537894. Similarly, the `Overall Return` enhances steadily, starting from 25831.835635711657 to 46604.20342681867.

The situation further improves as we move from **Year 10** onward. Here, the property registers positive `Overall CAGR`, increasing consistently year by year. By **Year 29**, the figure rises to 5.50754416726551, reflective of the compound annual growth strengthening over the investment cycle. Concurrently, the `Overall Return` grows to 207642.04502744103 in the same year, demonstrating a robust return on the initial `Total Investment` of 43862.5.

## Risk Assessment

Despite these positive indications, certain risks are noteworthy:

1. **Early Losses:** The investment bears initial losses, notably negative cash flows. The "Cumulative Annual Cash Flow" remains negative until a crossover in **Year 25** (when it turns positive at -31310.306617703973), indicative of a prolonged period before cash flows start becoming favorable.

2. **Sales Cost Impact:** Costs associated with selling (`Sales Cost`) compound over time, which unfavorably influences the `Overall Return`. By **Year 29**, the `Sales Cost` reaches 20599.79840744992, impacting the net returns upon exit.

In conclusion, the investment demonstrates significant initial risk but with potential for solid long-term gains. As the property's value appreciates and the equity builds up, it eventually yields positive returns and contributes to a favorable compound growth rate. Investors with a longer time horizon and capacity to bear early losses may find this property attractive for its eventual payout. However, they must remain cognizant of the initial negative returns and factor in the implications of the sales costs carefully in their financial planning.

## Assessment of CoCRoI

## Summary of CoCRoI Trends

The data provided spans a 30-year evaluation of a real estate investment. The Cash on Cash Return on Investment (CoCRoI) shows an initial negative trend, which is gradually turning positive as the years progress:

- **Initial Years (0-24):** The CoCRoI starts at -9.14% in Year 0 and remains negative until Year 24 with -0.08%. Throughout these years, there is a consistent negative CoCRoI, although the magnitude of negativity gradually decreases. The largest negative CoCRoI is in Year 0 with -9.14%, and it improves each year.

- **Mid-Point (Year 15):** By Year 15, the CoCRoI improves to -2.42%, showing a recovering trajectory although still negative.

- **Positive Shift (Year 25 onwards):** The CoCRoI turns positive starting from Year 25 with 0.25% and continues to increase up to 1.71% in Year 29. This indicates a turning point where the investment starts to yield positive cash returns relative to the initial capital investment.

- **Year 30:** An anomaly occurs in Year 30, with the CoCRoI dropping back to 0.13%. This could indicate increased costs or reduced income in this year relative to previous years.

## Risks Highlighted by CoCRoI Data

- **Extended Negative Period:** The extended period from Year 0 to Year 24 where CoCRoI is negative poses a significant cash flow risk. The investment will require external cash support to cover negative cash flows until these returns become positive in Year 25. 

- **Anomalous Year 30:** The drop in CoCRoI in Year 30 to 0.13% after reaching 1.71% in Year 29 requires attention. It may be due to a unique event or pattern such as increased maintenance costs, tax implications, or drop in rental income, which adversely affected cash flow.

## Cash Flow Analysis

- **Continually Negative Cash Flow:** The Annual Cash Flow mirrors the CoCRoI trend - it remains negative until Year 24, starting at -$4,009.52 in Year 0 and gradually ascending to -$35.65 by Year 24. This implies that additional capital will be required to support the investment during these periods.

- **Positive Cash Flow Onset:** Starting Year 25, Annual Cash Flow turns positive to $108.15 and improves to $748.93 by Year 29, before dropping to $58.10 in Year 30. These trends reflect the CoCRoI assessments indicating that profitability is realized starting Year 25.

## Recommendations

- **Financial Preparedness:** Investors should be ready to supplement cash needs initially for nearly 25 years before experiencing a financial breakeven.

- **Monitoring Costs/Fees:** Investigation into costs and income patterns to prevent adverse anomalies similar to Year 30 in subsequent years should be conducted.

- **Long-Term View:** Considering this investment as a long-term strategy could be beneficial, given the eventual positive returns after Year 24.

- **Analyzing Year 30 Drop:** A detailed investigation into the Year 30 decline in both CoCRoI and cash flow should be conducted to prevent future occurrences and refine income strategies. 

Careful management and a focus on maintaining and improving income streams beyond the 25th year will be essential for ensuring that this property continues to generate a favorable return thereafter.

## Historical CAGR Table

| Time Horizon | CAGR (%) |
|--------------|----------|
| 3-Year       | 25.38    |
| 5-Year       | 20.17    |
| 10-Year      | 11.91    |

## Assessment Summary

Based on the provided Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) data for the investment property:

- **3-Year Performance**: The property has experienced an impressive CAGR of 25.38%. This indicates a strong short-term growth trajectory, suggesting that the property has been in a market or condition that significantly boosted its value in recent years.

- **5-Year Performance**: Over a 5-year period, the CAGR is 20.17%. This slightly lower figure compared to the 3-year CAGR might indicate that the growth experienced more recently was extraordinary or that certain market dynamics have changed, but the property still retains robust growth characteristics.

- **10-Year Performance**: With a 10-year CAGR of 11.91%, the longer-term performance reflects historical stability and consistent appreciation. This rate is sustainable and positive over an extended period, emphasizing long-term value retention and growth.

## Risks and Considerations

- **Market Volatility**: The sharp change from a 10-year CAGR of 11.91% to a 3-year CAGR of 25.38% suggests potential volatility or sudden market changes. Investors should assess whether this rapid increase is sustainable and investigate the factors driving such growth.

- **Economic Factors**: It is crucial to consider broader economic conditions that may have influenced recent capital gains, such as inflation, interest rates, and local employment trends.

- **Dependence on Recent Trends**: While the recent upward trend is a positive signal, relying solely on short-term performance can be risky. Historical growth rates should be viewed in the context of the propertyâ€™s market, and adjustments should be made for any extraordinary conditions impacting these figures.

- **Market Correction Potential**: As with any substantial appreciation, there is a risk of a market correction. Investors should be cautious about assuming continued high growth rates and consider preparing for potential downswings.

These considerations will help in making an informed decision about investing in or continuing to hold this property.

## Price History Analysis

## **Initial Trended Downward Movement and Stabilization (2015-2016)**

The data indicates the property underwent a downward trend from $48,697 in January 2015 to $31,696 in August 2015, hitting a low of $24,206 in June 2016. This represents a significant drop of approximately 50.3% from the highest point at the start of the dataset to the lowest point. Such volatility in the early timeframe shows potential vulnerability, possibly reflecting overall market conditions or specific property issues.

## **Recovery and Growth Phase (2016-2020)**

Starting from the latter half of 2016, the property shows signs of recovery, reaching $42,242 in October 2016 and continuing the upward trajectory to $68,891 by August 2019. By December 2019, the price appreciated to $62,705, marking an appreciable increase from the trough in June 2016. The recovery indicates a positive sentiment returning, with the value nearly tripling from the lowest observed value ($24,206) within this period.

## **Stability and Incremental Gains (2019-2021)**

From mid-2019 to late 2021, the property value showed relative stability with incremental gains. By December 2021, the Zestimate reached $76,100, indicating a steady rise and possibly a consolidation phase where the price fluctuations stabilized, albeit with periodic dips that could mark seasonal trends or market corrections.

## **Recent Surge and High Volatility (2021-Present)**

In recent periods, especially from early 2023, the property exhibited a sudden surge, reaching $90,600 in June 2023. Interestingly, a conspicuous anomalous spike is observed from July 2024, where the price leaps from $57,700 to $146,000. By October 2024, the property value peaked at $150,000. Such rapid and disproportionate increase could indicate speculative buying, market aberrations, or significant property improvements.

## Risk Assessment

## **Historical Volatility and Market Sensitivity**

The history of this property shows significant periods of volatility with dramatic price fluctuations, especially during 2015-2016 and the recent anomalies in 2024. This indicates a risk factor related to market sensitivity that potential buyers or investors should be aware of. Such volatility may be due to externalities impacting the property sector or internal property limitations that were later rectified.

## **Potential Speculation**

The recent surges may also suggest speculative buying patterns or market overvaluation, which poses a risk if the market corrects this valuation. If rooted in speculation, these prices may not reflect true market conditions or property value, resulting in a correction.

## **Sustainability of Recent Gains**

Evaluating the sustainability of the current high valuations is critical. The consistent upward trend in 2021-2023 followed by the 2024 surge needs a deeper market analysis to determine if actual market dynamics and demand justify these prices, or if external factors may cause future price corrections.

Overall, while the property appears to be on a positive trend in terms of price appreciation recently, past volatility and future risk factors should be considered for a holistic evaluation and investment decision-making.

## Table

| Metric                               | Value |
|--------------------------------------|-------|
| Zestimate to Purchase price delta (%)| 2.41  |

## Assessment

The Zestimate to Purchase price delta is 2.41%, indicating that the Zestimate is currently 2.41% higher than the purchase price. This disparity suggests that the property was acquired slightly below its estimated market value, which can be favorable for the buyer, assuming the Zestimate represents an accurate assessment of market conditions.

## Risks

1. **Zestimate Accuracy**: The reliability of the 2.41% delta depends heavily on the accuracy of the Zestimate. If the Zestimate is not reflective of true market valueâ€”due to outdated data, atypical property features, or recent neighborhood market shiftsâ€”this could mislead the perceived investment value.

2. **Market Volatility**: Any future changes in market conditions could affect the validity of the current Zestimate. Economic downturns, neighborhood depreciation, or changes in property demand could erode perceived value benefits derived from the current estimate.

It is crucial for the prospective buyer to conduct additional due diligence, which may include obtaining independent appraisals, reviewing recent sale prices of comparable properties, and considering local market trends to solidify the market advantage suggested by this dataset.
