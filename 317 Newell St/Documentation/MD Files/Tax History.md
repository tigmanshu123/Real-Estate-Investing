## Analysis of Tax History

To analyze the tax history of the property, let's review the available data, which outlines changes in property value, tax payments, and increases over time. Below, I summarize the overall trends and any concerns noted.

- **Property Value Changes**:
  - From **2001 to 2023**, there have been fluctuations, with notable increases in the property value. For instance, in **2020**, there was a significant value increase rate of roughly **0.25**, boosting the value to **19,387**.
  - Most recent data from **2023** indicates a value of **25,050**, reflecting a substantial increase from previous years, with a value increase rate of **0.29** in 2023.

- **Tax Payments and Increases**:
  - The tax paid has seen a consistent upward trend over the years. From **495.20** in **1998**, taxes have increased to **1,286** by **2023**.
  - A strong tax increase rate was recorded in **2002** at **0.345**, coinciding with one of the major value increases.
  - Another sharp tax increase occurred in **2023**, where the tax increased by **0.12** to **1,286**.
  
- **Fluctuating Patterns**:
  - There were several years with no change in tax paid or value, such as **2014, 2015**, and **2017**, which could indicate a period of market stabilization or assessment updates.
  - In **2010**, the tax paid saw a considerable hike of **0.15**, reaching **1,252.98**. This noticeable change was not accompanied by a corresponding value increase.
  - Various negative value and tax increase rates occasionally suggest reassessments or adjustments, such as the year **2018**, which had a tax and value decrease rate.

## Summary and Risks

The property's tax history reveals a general trend of increasing tax obligations over the past 25 years, with a remarkably pronounced increase over the last decade. The most recent **2023** figures indicate both escalating property value and taxes, which could point to growing market value or reassessment of property standards.

## Potential Risks:

1. **Frequent Reevaluation**:
   - The frequent increases in taxes, particularly the steep rise in **2023**, indicate possible future reevaluation which can further affect the investment's cost structure.

2. **Unsteady Payments**:
   - The pattern of sharp increases without corresponding property value hikes in some years might reflect policy changes or assessment discrepancies that could reoccur.

3. **Market Volatility**:
   - If the upward trajectory in value and taxes continues, potential investors should anticipate potential hikes in property costs and adjust their projections accordingly.

In conclusion, while the property has shown a favorable increase in value and market desirability, investors should remain vigilant about the tax implications and strategize for potential increases that could affect long-term profitability.
