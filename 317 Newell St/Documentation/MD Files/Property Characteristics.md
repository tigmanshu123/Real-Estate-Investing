## Assessment

The property, built in 1908, is a single-family residential home with a decent living area of 1,384 sqft and a lot size of 6,599 sqft, indicating moderate space availability. The home has 3 bedrooms and 1 bathroom, making it suitable for small families or rental purposes. Its proximity to downtown and schools bodes well for convenience, as highlighted in the **Description**. The presence of central air cooling and forced air, gas HVAC systems are potential advantages ensuring comfort.

However, there are notable risks and uncertainties. The **Property Condition** being marked as "Needs TLC" and the lack of specifics under "Property Condition" and "Appliances" denote potential unforeseen repair costs that could affect profitability. The **Subject to short sale approval** status highlighted in the description introduces a complication that might delay or complicate the purchase process. Additionally, missing information such as **HOA Fees**, **Utilities**, and **Views** may be significant for a comprehensive assessment of recurring costs or benefits like community maintenance and aesthetics.
