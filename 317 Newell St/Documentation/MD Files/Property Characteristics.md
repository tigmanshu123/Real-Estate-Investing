## Property Assessment

The investment property is a historical single-family home built in 1908 and offers substantial living space of 1384 square feet. With 3 bedrooms and only 1 bathroom, the layout might limit appeal for larger families seeking additional bathrooms. The property's appeal is enhanced by a considerable lot size of 6,599 sqft and the provision of 2 garage spaces. Central air conditioning and a forced air HVAC system are positive features, ensuring modern comfort. However, several characteristics are missing, notably, the absence of information on appliances, HOA Fees, and utilities, which are essential considerations for calculating ongoing maintenance costs.

Highlighted risks include the property's condition being unidentified ("Needs TLC" from the description suggests potential need for renovation), and a "short sale approval", which can prolong transaction times and introduce uncertainty. Moreover, the absence of appliances and undefined property condition might escalate repair and outfitting costs substantially.

Overall, while the property presents a solid foundation for investment with potential upside, it's crucial to conduct thorough due diligence to uncover further details on property condition, appliance needs, and financial implications before proceeding.
