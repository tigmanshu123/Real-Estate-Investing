## Tax History Analysis

Upon reviewing the tax history data, it's evident that the property has experienced variable changes in both assessed value and taxes paid over the years.

- **Historical Trend of Assessed Value and Taxes Paid**: 
  - The assessed value of the property has seen significant variation. For example, in 1998, the value was approximately $13,853. In 2023, the value had increased to around $25,050. This indicates a steady increase in value over the decades.
  - Taxes paid have also fluctuated. In the late 1990s, taxes stood at $495.20. By 2023, it climbed to $1,286.

- **Significant Value and Tax Increases**: 
  - A particularly notable increase occurred around 2002. The value jumped by approximately 52.33% to $21,102, causing a substantial 34.52% increase in the tax rate, pushing the tax paid to $720.28.
  - Similarly, in 2020, the property value went up by 25.17% to $19,387, marking another period of pronounced increase.

- **Decreases and Stability**:
  - There were periods of stability and decrease as well. For instance, in 2014, the assessed value decreased by 5.20% while the tax increased by 11.65%, resulting in taxes amounting to $1,123.88.
  - A stable tax with no increase occurred in 2020, maintaining the tax paid at $1,145.94, suggesting a period of fiscal stability despite no change in property value.

## Potential Risks and Considerations

- **Tax Volatility**: The tax history reveals fluctuations in both value increase rates and tax increase rates. For instance, between 2013 and 2014, there was a tax increase disparity, where the tax rate for a lower valued year surprisingly saw an increase.
- **Missing Tax Data**: Noteworthy is the absence of specific tax data for some years, such as 2008, which could imply potential issues in record-keeping or omitted fiscal responsibilities.

Overall, the historical tax review indicates that potential investors or stakeholders should prepare for variability in tax obligations that could be linked to significant alterations in assessed value. The fluctuations highlight an element of unpredictability that should be accounted for in financial forecasting and investment strategies.
