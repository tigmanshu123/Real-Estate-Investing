## Estimated Rent Table

| Type            | Estimated Rent  |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Median Rent     | $1360.33        |
| Average Rent    | $1357.67        |
| 25th Percentile | $1262.38        |
| 75th Percentile | $1348.00        |

## Summary Assessment

The estimated rents data provided indicate a relatively narrow range of rental prices. The **median rent** stands at $1360.33, closely aligning with the **average rent** of $1357.67. This proximity between median and average suggests a balanced distribution of rent prices in the dataset without significant skewness. Moreover, the **25th percentile** of the estimated rent is $1262.38, indicating that 25% of the rental estimates fall below this value, while the **75th percentile** is at $1348.00, indicating that 25% are above this threshold.

The relatively close values between these percentiles and the median—specifically, a $97.95 difference between the 25th percentile and the median, and a $12.33 difference between the median and the 75th percentile—suggests a tight clustering of rent values. This lack of extensive variability may imply stability in the rental market represented by this data set. 

## Risks and Trends

- **Narrow Range of Rent Estimates**: The narrow spread from the 25th to the 75th percentile indicates the estimated rents do not vary widely, suggesting a potential risk if market conditions abruptly change, as there may not be substantial rental options across different price points.
  
- **Potential Data Homogeneity**: The slight variance in the estimates might imply that the data sources (Rentometer, Zillow, User inputs) potentially reflect similar properties or geographical areas lacking diversity. Before making investment decisions, further analysis to include diverse datasets could give a more comprehensive view of rental trends.

Overall, while the tight clustering of data suggests market stability, careful monitoring of external factors influencing rental markets is advised to mitigate unforeseen risks.
