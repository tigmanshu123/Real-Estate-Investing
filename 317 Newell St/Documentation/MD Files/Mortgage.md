## Mortgage Amortization Analysis

After evaluating the provided mortgage data spanning a 360-month period, here is a detailed assessment of the mortgage amortization schedule:

## Monthly Payments
- **Consistent Monthly Payment**: The monthly payment remains constant at approximately \$732.67 throughout the life of the loan. 

## Principal and Interest Breakdown
- **Early Payments**: Initially, a larger portion of each payment is dedicated to interest as seen in Month 1 where the interest payment is \$645.70 (88% of the monthly payment), compared to the principal payment of \$86.97.
- **Over Time Shift**: Over time, this balance shifts in favor of the principal. By Month 180, the principal payment has increased to \$250.93, while the interest paid decreases to \$481.73.

## Remaining Balance
- **Decreasing Balance**: The remaining balance decreases steadily from the initial balance, noted as \$108,663.03 after the first payment, to a final balance of nearly zero by Month 360.
- **Final Payment**: By Month 360, the principal payment is \$728.34, and merely \$4.32 goes towards interest, leaving an almost negligible remaining balance of 0.

## Risk Assessment
- **Interest Dominance in Early Payments**: There is a risk posed by the substantial interest payments in the initial phase of the loan. Being largely interest-heavy, there is little impact on reducing the principal early on. This may result in less equity building in the initial years, making it less favorable for homeowners looking to sell early.
- **Negative Remaining Balance in Simulation**: The final computation results in a slightly negative balance of -\$2.98 x 10^-9, a rounding artifact that normally should not occur. Itâ€™s negligible but should be addressed for precise accounting.

## Conclusion
The mortgage structure is typical of a fixed-rate amortization schedule, with higher interest payments initially transitioning gradually toward higher principal payments as the loan progresses. If maintaining a long-term property investment, this mortgage should fulfill its purpose well, gradually building equity over time.

For a more concise financial decision, visual representation through graphs should provide clearer insight into how these payments evolve over the mortgage term. This could be a line chart that illustrates the breakdown between principal and interest payments monthly, helping the investor better understand the amortization progression and visualize equity growth potential.
