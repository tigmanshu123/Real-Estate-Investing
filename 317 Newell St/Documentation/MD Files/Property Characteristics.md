## Assessment

The potential investment property is a single-family home built in 1908, with a living area of 1,384 sqft, featuring 3 bedrooms and 1 bathroom. A fence encloses the backyard, offering added privacy, and there is a detached 2-car garage—suitable for a family dwelling or rental property.

However, there are several aspects that present risks. The property's description indicates it "Needs TLC" and is "Subject to short sale approval", which could signify both additional repair costs and potential delays or legal challenges in acquisition. Some critical attributes have missing data, such as appliances and property condition, making it challenging to fully evaluate ongoing costs or renovation needs. The absence of HOA fees and utilities estimations could impact financial forecasting. Moreover, the house is quite old, necessitating a thorough inspection for any structural or foundational issues common in houses of this age.
