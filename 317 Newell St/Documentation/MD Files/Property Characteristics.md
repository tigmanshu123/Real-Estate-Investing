## Investment Property Assessment

The property, built in 1908, is a historically aged single-family home. With a living area of 1,384 square feet and featuring three bedrooms and one bathroom, it fits a typical family profile. The lot size is a reasonably spacious 6,599 square feet, which is favorable for outdoor activities or further improvements. However, the property's mention of needing "TLC" indicates that maintenance or renovations might be needed, constituting a potential risk factor.

The age of the property (115 years old) suggests the possibility of outdated systems and a higher need for repairs, especially considering that key utility information is not available (as indicated by missing "Utilities" and "Property Condition" data points). Furthermore, with unknown HOA fees and lack of appliance details, these could lead to unexpected additional expenses.

The insurance cost, available at $609 annually, seems moderately priced for the property's characteristics. The mention of it being "subject to short sale approval" might present an opportunity for price negotiation, yet it also adds complexity to the purchase process. Interested buyers should perform thorough due diligence, notably around structural condition and potential hidden costs, to adequately assess both the investment potential and associated risks.
