## Summary

The potential investment property summarized here is a SingleFamily home built in 1908 with a living area of 1,384 square feet. It comprises 3 bedrooms and 1 bathroom and offers a 2-car detached garage situated on a lot size of 6,599 square feet. The property is heated with Forced Air and Gas, and it includes Central Air cooling. One of the key risks of this investment is the necessity for "TLC," as mentioned in the description, indicating that the property may require significant repairs or maintenance. The property is subject to short sale approval, which can pose financial and timeline risks, potentially elongating the closing process. Another concern is the absence of information regarding Appliances, Utilities, and Property Condition, which are essential for a comprehensive evaluation of ongoing property costs and investment risk. Additionally, there is no data on HOA Fees, which could represent an unanticipated cost. Therefore, potential investors should be cautious and ideally conduct thorough due diligence to obtain more granular information on these missing elements before making a decision.
