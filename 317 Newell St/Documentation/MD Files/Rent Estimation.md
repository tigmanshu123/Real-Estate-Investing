## Estimated Rent Analysis

| Type           | Estimated Rent |
|----------------|----------------|
| Median Rent    | $1389.00       |
| Average Rent   | $1383.00       |
| 25th Percentile| $1284.63       |
| 75th Percentile| $1372.88       |

## Summary and Assessment

In analyzing the data from the JSON:

- The **Median Rent** is $1389.00, indicating that half of the rent estimates are at or below this value. This shows a stable central tendency in the rent estimates.
- The **Average Rent** is relatively close at $1383.00, slightly lower than the median, suggesting a minor skewness to the lower end in the rent distribution.
- The **25th Percentile** value of $1284.63 denotes the lower quartile of the dataset, representing that a quarter of the estimate falls below this rent. This provides insight into the lower range of the rental market.
- The **75th Percentile** at $1372.88 highlights the upper quartile, informing us that 25% of the estimates are above this figure, capturing higher-end rental pricing.
  
## Variances and Trends

The estimated rents present a tight range, with the **Median**, **25th Percentile**, and **75th Percentile** values being close to each other. This indicates a narrow distribution with less volatility in rent prices across different data inputs. The small difference between the average and median values further highlights this limited variance. 

## Risks and Considerations

- **Close Percentile Range**: The proximity of the **25th Percentile ($1284.63)** and **75th Percentile ($1372.88)** points suggests that there is not much variability across the majority of the rental data. This might imply a competitive market where prices are tightly packed, offering limited flexibility for rental increases without risking tenant turnover.
- The slight skewness indicated by the average being less than the median might hint at the presence of a few lower outliers affecting the mean rent slightly downward. It's crucial to understand these outliers' nature and frequency, as they might represent distressed properties or unique conditions in certain locations.

Overall, the estimated rent data exhibits a consistent pattern with limited variability, signifying a relatively stable rental market. However, the near-range confined within quartiles could potentially limit opportunities for aggressive rental growth strategies.
