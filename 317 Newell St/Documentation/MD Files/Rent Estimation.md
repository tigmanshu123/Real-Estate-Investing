## Summary of Rent Estimates

In the provided dataset, we observe relatively consistent rent estimates across the different measures, which suggest a stable rental market for the area in question.

- **Median Rent** is $1283.33, a value quite close to the **75th Percentile** ($1282.50). This indicates that half of the rents are below approximately $1283.33, suggesting that there's no significant skew in the rent distribution.
- The **Average Rent** stands at $1279.00, which is notably similar to the Median Rent ($1283.33) and lends further support to the indication of a symmetric distribution in rental prices, implying limited extreme values affecting the mean.
- The **25th Percentile** is at $1171.00, offering insight into the lower quartile of rents. The gap between the 25th percentile and the median (approximately $112.33) illustrates that there is a gradual increase in rent above the lower quartile.
- There's a narrow interquartile range, as the 75th percentile only marginally surpasses the Median Rent by $0.83. This closely packed data indicates low variance among the typical rent values, signaling minimal disparity among the upper-middle segment of rental properties.

Given these insights, the variance in estimated rents appears minimal, suggesting a balanced rental market. However, potential risks include a lack of movement in rent, which could either signal market stability or stagnation.

## Risks

- A relatively narrow range between the **25th** and **75th Percentile** ($111.50) suggests low volatility in the rental market. This may pose a risk in case of market dynamics, where significant external factors might not be quickly adjusted in rental prices.
- The similarities between **Median**, **Average**, and the **75th Percentile** raise the question of whether the market is potentially saturated, with limited room for rent increases or incentivizing new investors. 

Without additional data on market trends, economic factors, or regional demand, it is recommended to maintain close monitoring of any economic changes that might influence these stable trends. Overall, the data depicts a somewhat predictable rental pricing structure, with current values suggesting equilibrium rather than growth or decline.
