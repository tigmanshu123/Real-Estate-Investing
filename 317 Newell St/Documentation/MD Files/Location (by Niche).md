## Table of Assessment

| Assessment Type      | Assessment Outcome    |
|----------------------|-----------------------|
| Niche Area Feel      | Sparse Suburban       |
| Niche Overall Grade  | B                     |

## Summary of Overall Assessment

The potential property is located in a **Sparse Suburban** area, indicating a neighborhood that is less densely populated with more open spaces and possibly larger lots. This kind of area may appeal to families and individuals looking for a quieter, more relaxed lifestyle compared to urban settings.

The **overall grade of B**, as provided by Niche, suggests that the area is generally good but could have certain factors that are less than ideal. This grade considers elements such as crime rates, housing prices, family amenities, and school quality. A 'B' grade implies an above-average living environment but does not reach the pinnacle of excellence.

## Potential Tenants

This type of location and grading is typically attractive to:

- Families seeking a quiet environment with reasonable access to amenities.
- Individuals or couples who prefer a suburban vibe with potential proximity to parks or natural environments.
- Retirees who might enjoy the slower pace and less crowded living conditions.

## Risks

- **Moderate Rating**: With an overall grade of B, there might be concerns related to specific categories such as mediocre school ratings, modest housing market performance, or average crime rates. It is important to investigate these factors further to ascertain the specific strengths and weaknesses of the area.
- **Sparse Suburban Preferences**: Tenants looking for vibrant nightlife, a bustling social scene, or easy access to diverse job opportunities may find the sparse suburban setup less appealing, potentially narrowing the pool of potential tenants.

Overall, while this area has its appeals for specific tenant profiles, stakeholders should consider diving deeper into the reasons behind the B rating to comprehensively understand the area's advantages and challenges before making investment decisions.
